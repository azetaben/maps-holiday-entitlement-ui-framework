Feature: Local accessibility exercise
  The supplied contact page should load locally and remain usable for everyone.
  Known accessibility defects are reported as failures, never as expected passes.

  Background:
    Given the local accessibility exercise is open

  @LOCAL-01 @local_smoke
  Scenario: Local assets load and the fields support keyboard entry
    When I complete the local contact fields using only the keyboard
    Then the local Done button should have keyboard focus
    And the local page assets should have loaded


  @LOCAL-02 @accessibility
  Scenario: Automated WCAG and best-practice audit
    Then the local page should have no automatically detectable WCAG or best-practice violations

  @LOCAL-03 @accessibility
  Scenario: Content reflows at 320 CSS pixels
    When the local viewport is narrowed to 320 CSS pixels
    Then the local form and illustration should fit without clipping

  @LOCAL-04 @accessibility
  Scenario: Field labels remain available after entering values
    When I complete the local contact fields using only the keyboard
    Then the populated local fields should have visible associated labels
